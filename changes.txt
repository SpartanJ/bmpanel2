Bmpanel2 Changes
================

This is a ChangeLog, but in the asciidoc format.

.Changes from *2.0a* to *2.0.1a*
- Man page fix.

.Changes from *2.0.1a* to *2.1pre1*
- Fix http://code.google.com/p/bmpanel2/issues/detail?id=1[xfwm4 modal
  dialogs]
- Change texture filtering mode for stretching modes to PAD (works like
  GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE).
- New "center_offsets" parameter for stretching modes.
- Desktop switcher uses now the maximum width of all button states to calculate
  a width for its button.
- Implementation of "demands attention" feature. Flashy taskbar buttons.
- SIGUSR1 signal forces bmpanel2 to reconfigure itself.
- Change default blending mode to OVER in pseudo-transparency renderer.
- Add "paint_replace" widget parameter, it forces a widget to use COPY blending
  mode instead of OVER (for pseudo-transparency renderer).
- Man page is being installed to $(PREFIX)/share/man/man1 now instead of
  $(PREFIX)/man/man1.
- Add bmpanel2cfg utility. Also add python library to do remote bmpanel2
  manipulations (the library is very unstable, interfaces will be changed).
- Integrate few themes to the git tree (alduin, auriel, curvy, flora, striped).
- Add COPYING file (BSD/MIT style license).
- Minor bugfixes and tweaks.
- Documentation updates.
- Build scripts improvements.

.Changes from *2.1pre1* to *2.1*
- The 2.1 release is skipped. Consider 2.1pre1 as 2.1.

.Changes from *2.1* to *2.2* (not released yet)
- Fix transparency issues (garbage instead of wallpaper).
- Add ESETROOT_PMAP_ID handing, just in case.
- Enable locale for time in bmpanel2 (month names are now displayed correctly
  according to your locale).
- Add UTF8_STRING variant for WM(_ICON)_NAME properties. Fixes weird
  applications on weird WMs, like opera on pekwm.
- Get rid of the workspace hints usage. Therefore bmpanel2 can't stack its
  instances one on top of another anymore. It was buggy anyway.
- Add support for multiple monitors (Xinerama and XRandR).
- Fix wrong width calculation for clock text.
- Add a command line option that overrides default config file (--config).
- Add "monitor" option to the config file.
- Add "task_visible_monitors" parameter to the config file for the taskbar.
- Fix bug with ellipsized right/center aligned text.
- Add widget alternatives system and "preferred_alternatives" parameter to the
  config file.
- Add "pager" widget as a first alternative to "desktop switcher".
- Add "pager_current_monitor_only" boolean option to the config file.
- Change signals behaviour for remote bmpanel2 reconfiguration. It uses SIGUSR1
  to reload the config only and SIGUSR2 to reload the config and a theme too.
- Add customizable mouse actions (use, drag, kill).
- Add "pager" alternative to all themes in the git tree (thanks weakhead).
- Fix pekwm floating point exception bug (there was a logic error causing
  division by zero).
- Add "show-desktop" mouse action which implements _NETWM_SHOWING_DESKTOP.
- Remove GCC warning caused by size_t and printf (thanks Matthew William Cox).
  And that was true probably for x86_64 archs only, because size_t is 64 bits
  here.
- Bmpanel2cfg updates according to changes (not exactly up to date).
- Minor bugfixes, tweaks, build system imporvements and code cleanups.
