General order of actions:
	cmake . && make && make install

Makefile's traditional DESTDIR works with CMake!

CMake has its own configuration. For --prefix use:
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/prefix .

BMPanel2 currently installs following files:
	PREFIX/bin/bmpanel2
	PREFIX/share/bmpanel2/themes/native/*
	PREFIX/share/bmpanel2/themes/transpy/*

--------------------------------------------------------------
**** TODO: This is deprecated ****
You can also force separation for binary and data in two
completely different places.

        cmake -DBMPANEL2_BINARY_PATH=/full/path/to/bin
	      -DBMPANEL2_DATA_PATH=/full/path/to/data .

In that case:
	BMPANEL2_BINARY_PATH/bmpanel2
	BMPANEL2_DATA_PATH/themes/native/*
	BMPANEL2_DATA_PATH/themes/transpy/*
--------------------------------------------------------------

But using this variables isn't recommended! If you don't know what you're doing,
contact me, I'll explain and fix this guide.

Please keep in mind, bmpanel2 binary searches for themes in XDG standard
folders! Default ones should be somewhat:
	~/.local/share/bmpanel2/themes
	/usr/share/bmpanel2/themes
	/usr/local/share/bmpanel2/themes

But to be sure, use:
	env | grep XDG

Bmpanel2 also has a config file located in (depends on XDG env vars):
	~/.config/bmpanel2/bmpanel2rc

But in order to run bmpanel2 and test it, you don't need this. Just use:
	bmpanel2 -h
or
	bmpanel2 --help

There is a theme override parameter (default one is 'native'):
	bmpanel2 --theme=transpy
