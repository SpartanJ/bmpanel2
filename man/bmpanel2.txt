bmpanel2 - X11 NETWM compliant panel (desktop switcher, taskbar,
systray, clock, launcher, etc.) with themeing capabilities.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'bmpanel2' [-h|--help] [--version] [--usage] [--list] [--theme=<theme>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
BMPanel2 (bitmap panel) is a tiny little bar on the top of the screen
or on the bottom. It contains different "widgets" - the pieces of
functionality which help user to interact with his desktop. Some of
the default widgets include:

 . Taskbar - A list of tasks (windows) on the current desktop.
 . Desktop Switcher - Allows user to choose current desktop.
 . Systray - Also known as notification area.
 . Clock - No comments.
 . Launchbar - Allows user to run different programs in one click.

The main goal of this project is to create a simple, lightweight, nice
looking, but still useful panel, that will be accompanied with another
piece of a really good software - the Openbox 3.
